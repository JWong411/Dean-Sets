Dean Sets is a Rails 5/React app based on the card game, SET[SET](http://www.setgame.com/set).

From the official [SET](http://www.setgame.com/set) game website:

* What is a SET?

A SET is three cards where each feature, when looked at individually, is either all the same OR all different. Each card contains four features: color (red, purple or green), shape (oval, squiggle or diamond), number (one, two or three) and shading (solid, striped or outlined).

* How to play

SET is a speed game. The first to see a SET, calls out ‘SET’ and picks up the three cards that make the SET. There are no turns and no luck. Race to find as many SETs as fast as you can. Be the one who has the most SETs when the cards are gone, and you win! SET is a game of fast-thinking fun!
